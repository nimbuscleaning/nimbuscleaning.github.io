- The src folder contains all the files that were used to create the landing page (it is based on the backyard-landing theme - bootstrap)
- gulp is used to concat all the css and js files
- you will see that all the CSS is inlined into index.html - this is done manually after calling gulp (copy and paste)


### deployment
- `npm run build`
- copy the css into index.html
- run `git push origin master`
